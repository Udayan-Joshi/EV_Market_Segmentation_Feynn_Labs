# EV_Market_Segmentation_Feynn_Labs
This repository contains the full workflow for an EV market segmentation study in the Indian automobile sector. It uses data-driven analysis to identify consumer clusters based on income and price preference, supporting targeted EV adoption strategies. This project was completed as part of my internship at Feynn Labs.
